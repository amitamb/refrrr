Refrrr


Workflow:

1. User is on a website that has many links [originUrl]

Example:

    - http://www.google.com/search?q=java

    - http://news.ycombinator.com/

2. He wants to go through the links on the page.

(Normally he would open those links in new tabs)

    User decides to use refrrr.

    He has two options

    - Click on bookmark button for refrrr
	  OR
	- Changes URL by adding refrrr.com to end of domain name. (Example: http://www.rediff.com/ to http://www.rediff.com.refrrr.com/)
	
	which will take him to http://www.refrr.com/o=[originurl]

3. Now page reloads with iframe containing the [originUrl] and navigation bar at bottom with a tab at left for [originUrl]

   It will also have tablinks from previus sessions if user is logged in. 

   When user is not logged in 

[[

The bottom navigaton bar will have links

Navigation bar at bottom and its layout

   - Login page will be shown in a new iframe but it will not be shown in tabs list
   - When user logs in that login script should check if inside iframe update parent page's layout with username and mode + settings buttons
   - When logging is disabled
	 It is as if user is not logged in
   - else if he wants to
       - To continue with current session
       - Merge with previus session
       - Continue with previus session

//   - Also update server about current session if logging is enabled

** - Show mode only when logged in
	[Logging / Do not log]
